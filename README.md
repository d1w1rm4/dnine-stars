## 📧 Email Booking Feature
The website includes an **automated email booking system** that allows customers to send tour reservations or inquiries directly from the site.  
When a user fills out the booking form and submits it, their details are automatically sent to the agency’s designated inbox.

**Workflow Example:**
1. User fills out the booking form (name, contact, destination, preferred date).  
2. The website triggers an email request via **EmailJS** (or similar service).  
3. The agency instantly receives a formatted booking email containing all details.  
4. A confirmation message is displayed to the user.

This feature removes the need for backend hosting while maintaining secure and efficient client–business communication.
