Customers can fill out a form to request bookings or travel quotes, and the system automatically sends the details to the agency’s email.

**Workflow Example:**
1. User fills out the booking form (name, destination, date, contact info).  
2. PHP validates and sanitizes input data.  
3. PHP’s `mail()` or SMTP sends a formatted email to the agency’s address.  
4. User receives an on-page confirmation message.

This ensures a direct and efficient communication channel between customers and the travel agency.
